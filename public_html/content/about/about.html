            <p>After working
                for 10 years with the women in remote villages for their socio- cultural
                empowerment through Jnanavikasa women's programme, the president of the
                programme Smt. Hemavathi V. Heggade contemplated towards Economic

                opportunity less women. This company is facilitated by Shree
                Kshethra Dharmasthala Rural Development Project</p>

            </ul>

                women in Rural areas were identified, and the concept of manufacturing,
                marketing and consumption were explained to them through village level
                meetings.</p>
            <p>The interested were given in skill training through some of the well known
                institutes in India. Some of the institutes which helped in this process 
                were Small Industries Service Institute (SISI) - Bangalore, Central Food

                providers to the stakeholders. Initial finance was provided by SKDRDP and
                later the stakeholders themselves raised the share capital of 
                Rs. 1000/= per group and paid the same to provide the much needed capital. Assistance
